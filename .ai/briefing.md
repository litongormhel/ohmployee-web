# AI Briefing

## Mandatory Workflow Rules (apply to EVERY prompt, even if the prompt body does not mention them)

### Approval & Regression Gate
Before writing any code, schema change, or migration: present a short implementation plan
plus a regression risk assessment (what could break, what's untouched). STOP and WAIT for
explicit user approval. Do not implement in the same turn the plan is presented. This applies
even when the prompt already describes the approach in detail.
*Standing UI Standard Loop Override:* The UI Standard loop (`ohm#l0u8s2d9` onward) runs WITHOUT an approval gate. The loop pauses only on the stop conditions in `docs/architecture/ui-standard-briefing.md` section 10 or when verification fails. This overrides the generic "stop and wait" rule for this project only. Do not ask for approval again unless a stop condition triggers.

### ADR Architecture Lock Reference
ADR-001 location (read-only from mobile repo): `/Users/armanjr/Projects/OHMployee/OHMployee/.ai/architecture_locks/adr_001_coverage_architecture_v2.md`.
Do not edit the ADR from this web repo. If a loop requires an ADR update, log it in handoff under "ADR updates needed (Ohm applies in mobile repo)". In every loop report, state "ADR basis: <file + sections>".

### Permanent Architectural Rule Locks
1. **Rule #1 (Inactive Roster Persistence):** Employees who are disengaged, separated, or pending deactivation (`Resigned`, `AWOL`, `Terminated`) must **always** remain visible in the Inactive Tab for historical and reporting continuity. They must never be filtered out or hidden into isolated views that remove them from historical logs. Tab 5 (Deactivation) operates as a transactional queue for offboarding approval; Tab 6 (Inactive) serves as the persistent historical roster.
2. **Rule #2 (Safe Audit Logging):** Audit log triggers (`fn_audit_log`) must always use safe actor ID resolution (`resolve_audit_actor_id`) with fallbacks to `NULL` on `foreign_key_violation` to permanently prevent operational mutation failures (e.g. during employment status updates, resignations, AWOL, terminations) due to missing user profiles or FK constraints.
3. **Rule #3 (Plantilla Table & Universal Cards Contract):** The Deactivation Tab roster strictly enforces column layout `Emploc# / Member / VCode / Store / Position / Assignment / Status` (with Actions column completely removed); the Inactive Tab roster strictly removes `Clearance Status` and dynamically resolves operational/separation remarks from `plantilla.remarks` with waterfall fallback to `audit_logs`; and the `Table / Cards` view toggle must remain fully supported and crash-free across all status tabs (Active, On-Leave, Vacancy, Floating, Deactivation, Inactive).
4. **Rule #4 (Floating Compliance, Layout & Store Slot Restriction):** Floating records must continuously track duration and days elapsed for DOLE compliance monitoring (Article 301 maximum 180-day temporary layoff limit) via reactive countdown badges across table and card views. The Floating tab table strictly excludes the `Details` action button and the `Status` column, maintaining `Assign Store` as the single primary action. Store assignments for floating personnel in `AssignStoreModal` are strictly restricted to locations with open or available slots (`hc_filled < hc_total`, e.g., `1/2`), with fully occupied stores (`1/1`, `2/2`) filtered out and hidden to prevent over-allocation.
5. **Rule #5 (Employee Detail Navigation & State Preservation Contract):** Clicking an employee record across all status tabs (Active, On-Leave, Floating, Deactivation, Inactive) in both table and card views navigates to the dedicated full-page Employee Profile view (`/plantilla/[id]`), replacing the cramped right-side `PlantillaDetailDrawer`. The full-page view organizes employee data into 4 dedicated category tabs (Employment & Allocation, Schedule & Store Coverage, Benefits & Statutory, Activity & System Info) and features an always-visible top summary card and capability-aware actions bar (`Update Employment Status`, `Transfer Employee`, `Reassign HRCO`, `Request Deactivation`, `Request Deletion`). The return navigation link (`← Back to Plantilla`) strictly preserves the originating context (status tab, view mode `table` vs `cards`, search filter, account scope, and pagination page) via URL parameters, guaranteeing zero disruption of operational context when returning to the plantilla roster.
6. **Rule #6 (Store-Level Schedule & HC Allocation Matrix):** Merchandiser and store personnel scheduling supports granular, store-level duty day and shift time assignments paired with fractional Headcount (HC) Share distribution (e.g. Store 1: `MON-TUE-WED`, `8:00 AM - 5:00 PM`, `0.50 HC`; Store 2: `THU-FRI-SAT`, `8:00 AM - 5:00 PM`, `0.50 HC`). In the Dedicated Employee Profile (`/plantilla/[id]`), the previous separate 'Work Schedule & Rate' and 'Stores & Coverage' tabs are permanently consolidated into a single comprehensive **`Schedule & Store Coverage`** tab. It features a top global terms bar (Daily Wage, Designated Rest Days supporting 1, 2, or more days off, Assigned HR Coordinator) and a Store Schedule & Headcount Allocation Matrix displaying store branch, VCode, duty days, shift window, HC share, and external visibility presence badges (`DAYS • HC Share`). In `UpdateScheduleModal`, Store Name, VCode, and HC Share are strictly read-only to prevent encoding errors; store additions and deletions are completely removed (store assignments are governed exclusively by official Plantilla / Movement allocations); rest days support multi-select (e.g., Saturday and Sunday); and duty days and shift hours are fully configurable per store.

### Branch Policy
Work on `main` only. Never create a branch unless the prompt explicitly says "create a branch".
Never merge, push, or delete a branch on your own initiative. If the session environment
created a branch (e.g. remote/cloud task isolation), report it in the handoff entry; Ohm
verifies, merges to `main`, and deletes it.

### Database Access & Modification Rule
No DDL, function execution, or writes against any Supabase project without Ohm's explicit instruction in that prompt, and NEVER from a UI loop. All database access for UI work is strictly prohibited.

### Supabase Environments & Project References
- **Production:** `rwxelulyapjgaarlwkus`
- **Staging:** `qqiiznmqxfoamqytjica`
- Agent sessions and localhost must use staging (`qqiiznmqxfoamqytjica`).
- NEVER connect to the production ref (`rwxelulyapjgaarlwkus`).

### After Every Completed Prompt (mandatory, in this order)
1. `.ai/briefing.md` — prepend PROMPT ID + title to "Last Completed Tasks" (keep only 5)
2. `.ai/handoff.md` — prepend full handoff entry
3. `docs/state/<module>_state.md` — surgical update if behavior changed
4. Local commit (see "Local Commit Rule" below)
5. Branch close-out — if a branch exists, Ohm verifies (`npm run lint` / `npm run build` /
   manual test), merges into `main`, then deletes the branch. AI only reports the branch.

### Local Commit Rule (every prompt, after items 1-3)
- Commit LOCALLY on `main`. NEVER `git push`, merge, rebase, amend, reset, or delete anything.
- Stage ONLY the files this prompt changed, by explicit path. Never `git add .` or `git add -A`.
- Include the doc files updated in items 1-3 (briefing.md, handoff.md, state file) and any new
  migration file this prompt created. Committing a migration file does NOT apply it.
- Before committing, run `git status`. If a file this prompt touched already had uncommitted
  changes from before this prompt started, do NOT stage it. Report it and skip the commit.
- Commit only if verification passed: `npm run lint` clean for any code change (docs-only
  prompts need no lint). If verification fails, do not commit; report the failure.
- Commit only if on `main`. If on any other branch, do not commit; report it.
- Message format: `<PROMPT ID>: <PROMPT TITLE>`.
- After committing, report the commit hash and the exact files included.

State files = current stable behavior only. handoff.md = active sprint continuity only.
Archive obsolete logs to `docs/archive/`.

## Last Completed Tasks
1. **ohm#branch2-remove-system-record-metadata (Remove System Record Metadata Card on Branch2)**: Removed the verbose `System Record Metadata` card (UUIDs, internal IDs, clearance state) from the Activity tab in `src/app/(dashboard)/plantilla/[id]/page.tsx`, keeping the employee profile focused on clean operational data and the Lifecycle Event Log & Audit Timeline. Verified `npm run lint` clean (0 errors); changes isolated on `Branch2`.
2. **ohm#branch2-multistore-roving-allocation-display (Display Multi-Store Roving Allocations in Employment & Allocation Tab on Branch2)**: Updated the store assignment display in `src/app/(dashboard)/plantilla/[id]/page.tsx` for multi-store and roving employees. When an employee is roving across 2 or more stores, the card dynamically reflects `Assigned Store Allocations` with a `Roving • N Stores` badge, listing all assigned stores with primary tags, store VCodes, and exact fractional Headcount (HC) shares (e.g., 0.50 HC), while preserving the single-store layout for stationary staff. Verified `npm run lint` clean (0 errors); changes isolated on `Branch2`.
3. **ohm#branch2-reset-schedule-with-confirmation-and-save-blocking (Reset Schedule with Confirmation Modal and Save Blocking on Branch2)**: Added a `Reset Schedule` action in `UpdateScheduleModal.tsx` allowing operators to easily wipe duty days, shift times, and rest days clean without editing each store individually. Added a pre-reset confirmation dialog (`Reset Schedule & Work Terms?`) explaining the action. Enforced strict save blocking (`isScheduleComplete`) so that empty or partially filled schedules cannot be saved to the database (disabling the save button and showing an alert banner). Verified `npm run lint` clean (0 errors); changes isolated on `Branch2`.
4. **ohm#branch2-structured-numeric-time-segment-input (Structured Numeric Time Segment Input on Branch2)**: Replaced plain text time inputs in `UpdateScheduleModal.tsx` with dedicated structured `TimeSegmentInput` controls enforcing `--:-- --` format: strictly accepts numbers only for Hours (01–12) with auto-advance on 2 digits or colon; fixed non-editable colon separator; strictly numbers only for Minutes (00–59) with backspace auto-focus return; one-click AM/PM toggle pill; and interactive clock picker overlay. Fully declarative without cascading render effects. Verified `npm run lint` clean (0 errors); changes isolated on `Branch2`.
5. **ohm#branch2-paired-time-in-time-out-pickers (Dedicated Time-in and Time-out Shift Pickers on Branch2)**: Replaced plain text shift window inputs in `UpdateScheduleModal.tsx` with paired 2-column floating-label fieldsets for `Time-in` and `Time-out` per design upload `media_1793867989857_2eb21438.png`. Added 12-hour formatted text inputs (`00:00 AM/PM`) with `--:-- --` placeholders, embedded top border legends, and clickable `Clock` icons triggering native HTML time pickers with bidirectional 12h/24h conversion and auto-concatenation into `${timeIn} - ${timeOut}` for persistence. Verified `npm run lint` clean (0 errors); changes isolated on `Branch2`.
